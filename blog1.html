            <img class="img1" src="/images/investor.svg" alt="Investor">
            <p class="para"> After reading books and watching few videos, I marked out few good points which you need to
                consider as a Value Investor. Being a Value Investor you need to understand that you are not just buying
                the share of a company rather you are going to own some part of that company. So, before investing your
                hard earned money on any company it is appreciable if you perform your own analysis.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let me give you a detailed explanation for the same. Before we start let me tell you what value
                investing is? So in value Investing you a pick a stock which is trading below its Intrinsic value and
                sell it when stock become overvalued. This is a very simple definition of value Investing. So now I am
                going to tell you what are the steps you need to take as a value Investor:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li> Find a fundamentally strong stock </li>
                    <li> Buy when it is undervalued. </li>
                    <li> Sell the stock when it becomes over-valued</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <br>
                These are three simple steps one should follow as a value Investor. Now I am going to tell you some
                principles of the Value investing which you need to focus on: -
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Before you go for stock selection, or anything related to value Investing, you should be compatible
                        with the insights of that thing.</li>
                    <li>Find out those companies which are cash rich, means those company which has enough cash to pay their
                        debt. </li>
                    <li> Search for those companies which have minimal debt or Zero debt</li>
                    <li> Do EIC analysis know as Economic-Industry-Company analysis </li>
                    <li> Check for the promoter details and their history and know what is their worth for the company means
                        always rely on High Quality Management</li>
                    <li> Avoiding loss should be your first priority.
                        Example: let me give you an interesting ex: If a stock falls by 20% and then it recovers back by
                        20%, In this case you are still in loss</li>
                    <li> Focus on long term capital gain, means always consider for long term investment</li>
                    <li> Always know when to exit or when to sell off </li>

                </ul>
                
                <br>
                <br>
                These are principles of the value Investing. There is one famous quote by warren buffet that says,

                <strong>“Price is what you pay, and value what you get,”</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                So always remember these points as value Investor. At the end I would like to say this again that you
                are not buying the shares of the company, you are buying a part of the company or you are becoming the
                partner of the company. So analyze the company carefully and invest safe.
