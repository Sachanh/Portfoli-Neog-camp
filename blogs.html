            <p class="para"> After reading books and watching few videos, I marked out few good points which you need to
                consider as a Value Investor. Being a Value Investor you need to understand that you are not just buying the
                share of a company rather you are going to own some part of that company. So, before investing your hard
                earned money on any company it is appreciable if you perform your own analysis.
                Let me give you a detailed explanation for the same. Before we start let me tell you what value investing
                is? So in value Investing you a pick a stock which is trading below its Intrinsic value and sell it when
                stock become overvalued. This is a very simple definition of value Investing. </p>
